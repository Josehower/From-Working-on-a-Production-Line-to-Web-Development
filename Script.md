# My Beginning in Austria

- My family

  - I studied music, and my dream was to become a recognized composer and musician.
  - After finishing my studies, I found the real life is not as easy as it sounds.
  - And I ended up working as a music teacher.
  - The teaching was good, but the school environment was something that I never really fully understood.
  - As music teacher in colombia i had a lot of students but too few hours with them, what for me was not significant enough.
  - And then when Sofia come my priorities fully changed. I will do anything in my hands in order to give her the best possible future and opportunities.
  - So after founded i could apply for austrian citizenship and apply for it. Was only a few years, until i was ready to travel.
  - I bought the Flight one year before. i wanted to have a date for my new adventure.
  - The plan was clear marriage in june, travel in february. But two months before the marriage we found we were pregnant.
  - That makes things a little bit harder but i guess sometimes you can't plan everything.
  - the day of the travel i flight with my mom, my grandma, Marcela and two kids in my heart.
  - I traveled with my brother and i had a lot of feelings. In one hand was cool start this new beginning, but in the other i had a lot of responsibility.
  - Marcela and kids need to follow me as soon as possible and i knew this was not going to be easy
  - Being a foreigner that in addition barely speak english and no german was was really hard.
  - What sometimes people forget is when you don't speak the lenguage of the place you are even simple things as a doctor appointment is a big trouble
  - And a lot of people judge you, people see you and say thinks like you know is your responsibility. I believe me i do, and this is why i am taking german courses. But this transition takes time. in my case a year and a half.
  - one year and a half without seeing my wife or my kids, i lost the first year and a half of Jose Alejandro. And there where days that i just felt really alone and asking myself if all this things worth the effort.
  - Because at the end that was only the beginning.
  - I remember one day my friend Markus called me and asked me if i would like to try a job in a production line.
  - I was desperate and even if i had 0 experience in a factory i could'nt say no.
  - And that was me taking this job that allow me to have the regular income necessary to bring my family with me again. The only thing that really matter.

# Need for a change

- once my family was here i had a time of comfort and the point was making sure Marcela was able to do the transition into this new culture
- Kids kindergarden and school gave me not time to think in my professional life for three years
- But after that i begin to feel bad, my job was not really fulfilling me and i was not really proud abut my day to day lifestyle
- as you can imagine shift working break your sleep cycle and you feel tired most of the time. It get better with the time, but to be honest i really never got completely used to it.
- At some point in 2019, maybe september or October, i knew i wanted something else.
- I just knew didn't want to go to teaching music in a school again. The problem was ok if i am not doing that, then music is not an option (and fortunately i didn't got that route with covid around the corner).
- But if music was not an option then what?
- If i wanted a career change i needed to do it just right.
- And after some time i found that what i really wanted was make a positive impact and having a regular income at the same time, and probably something related with the online world.

- I researched different things, but nothing really make a click. I did some online courses on digital marketing but i was not real happy. And then the idea of coding come to me.
- At the beginning i was hesitant.
- Is not coding for computer scientists?
- I am not too old to learn to code?
- Am i smart enough?
- How long it would take?

# The plan

- I needed to make comfortable with the terminology and find a route path.
- So i just download some podcasts that allow me to learn what where the issues and the day to day of a developer.
- I did some research and i make the decision that i wanted to go with the web dev route
- at the time i remember i was wearing my headphones and over them i wear the earmuffs. I was just hearing podcast and i know was maybe not the safest but was the way i found to learn as fast as i could.
- the first time i heard a podcast i thought they was talking in a different lenguage, but i just keep hearing different episodes and trying to understand all this new ecosystem.
- every free time that i had, when kids where sleeping or in the travel to work i was watching videos or reading articles about the topics i really didn't understand
- And that way in no time i was already happy when they talk about terms as DOM arrays loops and arrow functions.

- One big breakpoint for me was going back once and again to an episode called Javascript fundamentals.

- i did a list with the topics wes and scott point out in this episode and in one month i focused on understand each of these.

- Here the times are a little bit blurry but i think in february i hear about this places called bootcamps when you go to leaning code.

- and after some research i found the UpLeveled. I write in the chat bubble and start my contact with Antje. after some chat she called me and i never expected that this call would change my life in the way it did.

- She explain me all the process and i found that i didnt had the money for the bootcamp and decided to postpone it for some months. during this time i was saving money and start to do my first web applications in vanilla JS.

- In the night shifts when you are lucky enough the machines are running automatically so you got at least 2 or 3 hours almost free. My colleages usually sit down to watch videos or play phone games, but i knew i can use that time in a better way.

- I wanted to code but the only computer i had access was the computer used to weight the plastic that we send to recycle. After a quick check i notice there was no way to install any program but that it was connected to the internet, only internet explorer was avaliable but i had my dev environtment for the night shifts.

my stack at the time was IE and notepad, was a good learning process having to type every opening and closing tag of the html and debugginh errors by eye.

- i even notice curl was installed. So loooking into the internet i found the commands to and download images from apis and i felt like a hacker the first time i did it.

# The plan

- I think Joining the bootcamp was an excellent decision since having a mentor that organize and strucuture the topics in a way that make sense helped me to advance into a completelly new speed.

- thinks that may take to learn months on my own ended up happening in days once i had a group of people that help me with the doubts and misunderstandings.

- Once the bootcamp started i begin to see that all the preparation i did before worth the effort.

- I found myself in a good position that allow me to have a deeper understanding about the topics i studied. and being a teacher allowed me to help other students in my cohort what showed up my skills to the UpLeveled team who ended up making me a Job offer before the bootcamp finished.

- Now being in the team i found all the doubts and fears that i had shouldn't be there, development is not only for computer science graduates and actually all the backgraund in music and teaching allow me to see things in a different perspective what ended up being really valuable for the team.

- Also my latin spirit and spanish skills help me in my day to day job helping people that may fill similar to me and are new in the country and feel same as i felt before seeing that almost everything is hard at the begginning.

- and last but not least i feel fullfill and happy in my profesional life because i can give my grain of sand into the transformation of people that dream to make a carreer transition in the same way i dreamed before.
