In the first 5 minutes i would like to create a connection with the public.

its important to use the power of storytelling here.

## I am just a human with a lot of mistakes

## I am really passionate but this is not necessarily good

reference?? https://youtu.be/RZRY4Uaa3Z4?t=177

One of the differentiation i can make is show what makes me human my mistakes and errors. But how even whit that i was able to change my life into a code career.

1. Sometimes you hear how the people had already clear what they wanted and how they knew from the very beginning what they wanted and how they will get it.

I just don't. I thought i knew, but in reality i don't.

If you asked me 6 years ago what i wanted to be doing now, i never would said being a developer.

Start with the basketball game story (unicorn joke)

1. i was trying to do something different
2. in the middle i felt released (comfort zone)
3. All end up different as intended but being even better

It seems luck at first glance (and kind of was, but everything that happened before matters and i could use it in favor).

The point i want to make is how all the background you have and specially if you can see the things from a different perspective can be used in your favor helping you into become a developer.

After i tell you my story i want you to understand that if i get the chance to be a developer and the skills i had from my previous background matter, you or anyone you know with a little bit of creativity and using the resources that have at hand can do the transition into a developer career.

keep going showing how this talk is going to be different as other talks when the speaker say (since i was a child i liked to do houses, then i just was passionate a bout houses, now i do houses for a living).

NOT

as a child i was just playing videoGames, then at the age of 13 i learn to play the guitar and also to play Dungeons and Dragons, yu gi oh and then Magic the Gathering and studied music at the university (i failed to enter in the conservatory but i was accepted on the music teacher university). And after trying to do what i wanted (a musician i failed) and ended up being teacher of a school.

I didn't like it and i was wasted, but i was so lucky and found the reset button, and i just pressed the reset button and travel to austria To be a musician.

But then i notice this was not going to happen (because the only thing that matter for me was in Colombia) and with the options i had at the time wouldn't be possible.

So if you are expecting i tell you hey if you want it you got it ill tell you sometimes we have to work with the things we have in hand, and understand failure is part of the process.

I got some jobs cleaning restaurants and offices, but i just found i was not agile enough for that.

And i was just using the free time to become a better magic player, and learning english and a little bit of german in the process.

The nice thing is i knew Markus Pfeferkorn in the magic store, and after he knew my story he helped me to enter in the company he worked as electrician.

And i was there like the ball in the middle of the air after the sound of the game end.

I knew the plan was screwed but at least there was nothing i can do to change that and then i felt released.

Working on the company was not easy but helped me to bring my family into austria. and then the comfort zone come.

then thing is i never imagined that working on this company was going to teach me a lot of skills that i was going to used to become a developer.

**\*\***\*\***\*\***\_**\*\***\*\***\*\*** think a little bit this
Problem solving
Working with i had at hand
attention to details
and repairing things that you have no idea how to repair.

story how this company transform my point of view and how i used the computer in the company to create my firsts apps with word pad and internet explorer.

then talk about how doing the bootcamp i knew seeing the world from a different perspective may help you as developer (apps need to be develop for a wide range of people to represent this groups in the right way)

Explain how coding can push your carreer into the next level even if you dont want to be a developer. (my brother have been asked to program to automate excel sheets).

learn to code gives you superpowers.

all what you need is a browser and wordpad.

---> something i am really good at is using the free time i have in something fan that at the same time helps me (or at least really good finding excuses about why i spend the time in the things i spend it)

At the end i need to do a recap joining the game with the travel to austria making sure i point that everything i did before matters, and even things are not in your control are influenced by your desicions and the things you did and all of us have skills that matter and may help you to become a developer.

so if you are planing to become a developer just be creative and be sure all the background you have matters and this is the beauty of this career.
